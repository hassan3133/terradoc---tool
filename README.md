# terradoc Tool 

Using HCL syntax, Terradoc is a lean assistance tool that generates human-readable documentation.

## Installing

## Introduction

With Terradoc you can
* have a documentation that is almost never outdated
* generate human-readable HTML and [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org/) reports
* configure additional Terraform state values to be included in the documentation
* attach manually written documentation to an autogenerated section
* create virtual resources in order to represent parts of your infrastructure, that are normally expressed by a single Terraform resource (e.g. k8s Deployment > Pod > Container )


To install **terradoc** using Go just run:

```
go install github.com/mineiros-io/terradoc/cmd/terradoc@<version>
```

Where **<version>** is any terradoc [version tag](https://github.com/mineiros-io/terradock/tags),
or if you are feeling adventurous you can just install **latest**:

```
go install github.com/mineiros-io/terradoc/cmd/terradoc@latest
```
